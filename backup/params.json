From this place you’ll be able, not only to know me and contact me but also to read some thoughts I usually write in my blog. Leading IT portfolios is my main area of expertise and currently I’m working as the Head of IT in one of the largest entertainment companies in Argentina, leading teams, collaborating with people, growing together and most importantly, having fun.\r\n\r\nPlease visit http://www.gastonalgaze.com where you'll be able to find more detailed information.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n//Gastón"}
